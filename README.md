# Hanson-Resilience-Slides
Supplemental Slides for Jamie Hanson's talk at 7th International Symposium on Resilience Research (on 2021-09-30).

I presented at the 7th International Symposium on Resilience Research, but we were running short of time. I therefore cut all of the "fun" ideas that I wanted to share with the group (so I thought I would share things here... so there's a pdf of my supplmental slides in this repo).
